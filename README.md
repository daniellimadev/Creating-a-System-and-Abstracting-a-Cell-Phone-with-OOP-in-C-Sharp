## Design challenge
For this challenge, you will need to use your knowledge acquired in the object orientation module, from DIO's .NET track.

## Context
You are responsible for modeling a system that works with cell phones. To do this, you were asked to abstract a cell phone and provide ways for different brands and models to have their own behavior, enabling greater code reuse and using object orientation.

## Proposal
You need to create a console-type system in .NET, mapping an abstract class and specific classes for two types of cell phones: Nokia and iPhone.
